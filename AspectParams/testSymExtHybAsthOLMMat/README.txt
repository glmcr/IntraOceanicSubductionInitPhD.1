Keeping this for posible future work:

Interesting inception of forced convection in the upper mantle by symmetric oc. lith. kinetic extension

my aspect-fork code branch: hybAsthOLMMat.pTU.sszOLMPTCorr.noMTCOnSides.sszOcMTC.pMPa.LUSICompoParticles

See the saved vtu files in the VTU folder

TODO: Test the reset of the accumulated total strain to zero using the markers for the newly created
SSZ materials (oc. crust and oc. lithos. mantle).
