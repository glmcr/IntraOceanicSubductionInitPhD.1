1). WIP: Metamorphic transformations using ASPECT particles properties:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Use the initial compostion as a particle property.

Use a different generic metamorphic phases T-P pseudosection for each generic starting 
rock types(which we can consider as protoliths).

ex. oceanic basalt, oceanic pelagic sediment, gabbro, peridotite and so on.

Each of those generic starting rock types could have a particular metamorphic facies
depending on the T-P conditions faced by the particles. Ex. the sediments and basalts
protoliths can eventually have all the classic metamorphic facies types but gabbros and
peridotites stay usually "pristine" unless they are subjected to metasomatism. 

(NOTE: metasomatism and protoliths dehydration need to be parametrized)

The initial composition is always available from the particles properties so we can
always track the prograde(and retrograde ??) metamorphic facies changes for each particle.

2). Test if we can do simulation "A la Gerya" with Aspect i.e. without eulerian advection 
    of energy and compositional fields. Energy and composition fields would then be advected
    only as properties of lagrangian particles.

    The "Nonlinear solver scheme" parameter to be used to do so is "no_advection_<single,iterated>_stokes"
